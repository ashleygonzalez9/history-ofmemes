				<center><h2>What are Memes?</h2>
				<p> A meme is a picture such as Thanos with texts that poke a little fun at a cultural society. A wide variety of memes that we see today in the modern age are intended to be funny. Also another variety of memes have already died out like the original meme. It doesn't even make an appearance at all, at least now in the moder age because it is the 21st century now we are looking for something new. Not some old dead meme.  Other memes can be videos or even sounds such as the Pepe the frog screaming "reeeeee". Like the pepe the frog meme people forget about it and it dies out. So then more memes will be found repairing the meme population adding to the many other memes out there.  #respectdamemes  </p></center>

				<p> The picture that you see here is the original memes posed on twitter back in 1921. Originally the two images where alone with no captions. This was supposed to be a innocent comic edition of satirical magazine The Judge. Then it was published at the Wisconsin University between 1919 and 1959.  When people saw the pictures they decided to add other captions such as the one on the left. Eventually this image along with the captions spread around and more memes like videos and other funny pictures and sounds survived until the modern age today. If memes have come this far, what will the future of memes be like?     </p>

			<center><p> This image that you see is on of the most popular memes out there. The song Someone like you was written by Adele and Dan Wilson. Adele started singing and then the crowd staring singing and became a meme. There were many memes of this like the Tik Tok meme witch look to be like nikels. the video starts off with one single coin with Adele singing solo. Then the camera rotates to more than a dozen coins with the crowd singing in the background. In my opinion this is high quality content on youtube by QKEE T. This is one of the best memes I have ever seen LOL. </p></center>
